<h2 id="the-vi-editor">The vi editor</h2>
<p>This editor is installed by default in both Linux and MacOS and can be accessed and used through the terminal window.</p>
<p>These are some of the advantages of vi:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is available in all Unix systems and any type of terminal.</li>
<li>It doesn't require a lot of memory to run. So, if you are running many heavy programs in your computer, vi is a good option because it won't slow down the machine anymore and will still load very fast.</li>
<li>Even though there are a lot of commands that you must learn to become skilled in using this program, once you learn them you can use very short and fast commands to accomplish a lot of things.</li>
<li>You can use it to code in different languages.</li>
<li>Some editors add special characters to the text and when you run scripts written in those editors, they could fail. vi doesn't add any special characters, and if a script has any, they are visible in the editor.</li>
<li>If you don't like using your mouse too much, or you don't have a mouse, or your mouse doesn't work properly, then vi editor is a good choice because you rarely need to use the mouse. Most things are accomplished using the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some disadvantages too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The learning curve can be steep, especially for people who are new to programming and not very comfortable with computers. If you're new to bash, you not only need to learn the language, but also a whole set of commands specific to this program.</li>
<li>Not being able to use your mouse can end up wasting your time while you learn all the commands that are used to scroll around the file or jump from one line to another.</li>
<li>It doesn't give you any error messages or explanation of why it's not doing what you want. If you type the wrong command, it will just do nothing (or do the wrong thing).</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new file, type (on the command line) <code>vi file_path/file_name</code>. For example, if you want to create a file called test.sh in the desktop, you should type <code>vi ~/Desktop/test.sh</code>. The vi editor will open in the current terminal.</p>
<p>This program runs in two modes, the command mode and the typing mode. By default, it opens in command mode. What this means is that anything you type is not actually being registered in the file but are commands. For example, if you type <code>:q!</code> as soon as you open the file, it will quit without saving (because <code>:q!</code> is the command for ignoring any modifications and exiting). If you type <code>:w</code> it will save changes to the file (or if you haven't write anything, it will just create an empty file). To change to typing mode, type <code>a</code> (<code>a</code> is the command for entering typing mode). After you type <code>a</code>, you can start editing your file. To go back to command mode (for example to save changes), press the key esc (top left corner of the keyboard).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Open the vi editor, create a script that prints <code>"Hello Word"</code>, and save it with the file name <code>helloword.sh</code></p>
<p>Step 1: Open the vi editor</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vi helloword.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Step 2: Type <code>a</code> to start editing the file. You will see that an <code>--Insert--</code> message in the bottom of the terminal appears. This means that now you are in typing mode.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-- INSERT --
</code></pre>
<p>Step 3: Start typing commands. The simplest command, to print a message such as <code>"Hello World"</code> (or any other) is <code>echo</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo &quot;Hello World!&quot;
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-- INSERT --
</code></pre>
<p>Step 4: Once you finish your script, press the esc key to enter command mode. You will see that the <code>--Insert--</code> message at the bottom of the terminal disappears (this means that now you are in command mode).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo &quot;Hello World!&quot;
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
</code></pre>
<p>Step 5: Save changes and exit the vi editor. In order to do this, type <code>:wq</code> (to write and quit at the same time). The table below will show you the most commonly used commands for vi.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo &quot;Hello World!&quot;
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
:wq
</code></pre>
<h2 id="list-of-vi-commands">List of vi commands</h2>
<p>In general, a number preceding any vi command will tell vi to repeat the command that number of times. For example, <code>p</code> is the command for pasting. If you write (in command mode) <code>2p</code>, vi will paste whatever you copied two times where the cursor is currently located.</p>

<li><a href="https://eclipseide.org/">Eclipse</a>: this is a lot more than an editor; it is a development environment used for programming in many other languages and for software development and modeling.</li>

<h2 id="tips-for-writing-scripts">Tips for writing scripts</h2>
<ol>
<li>Albeit not mandatory, the first line of any bash script should be the shebang (<code>#!/bin/bash</code>). It indicates that the script is written in bash (instead of tcsh, for example) and that the bash interpreter should execute it.</li>
<li>Be organized when writing scripts. As you start writing longer and more complicated programs, this will become more important.</li>
<li>Comment as often as possible, so that other people can understand what your script is doing, which parameters are needed and what they mean, or the output means. To insert a comment, start the line with a hash (<code>#</code>).</li>
<li>Use indentation to know where pieces of code start and end (for example when doing loops). If you don't indent, understanding your own code will be very difficult.</li>
<li>Use appropriate variable names. Use names that are associated to the structure you're using (for example, if you're creating an array, naming it <code>array</code> will help you remember that this variable is an array and not a string or a number).</li>
<li>Use short variable names. For example, instead of naming a variable <code>myListOfSubjects</code>, you can call it <code>subjList</code>.</li>
<li>Use the following commands at the beginning of any script:<ul>
<li><code>set -e</code>: this will make the program exit as soon as it encounters an error, preventing it from running commands on wrong data.</li>
<li><code>set -u</code>: this will make the program exit when using undeclared variables, preventing it from executing the wrong commands if you misspell a variable name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use double quotes (<code>"</code>) when declaring a string, single quotes (<code>'</code>) when declaring a character, and no quotes when declaring numbers. This will prevent word splitting (when declaring a string that has spaces) and other errors in your code.</li>
<li><a href="../advanced_bash/#using-functions">Use functions</a>. This will make your code more readable, reusable, and will allow you to run only parts of the code without having to comment all the lines when debugging.</li>
<li>If you are declaring a variable whose value should never change, use the word <code>readonly</code> before the variable name. For example, if you want to declare a variable called <code>age</code> with value <code>30</code> and this value should never be replaced, then you should declare <code>readonly age=30</code>. If at some point in the script you try to replace the value of that variable, you will get an error message: <code>-bash: age: readonly variable</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="running-a-script">Running a script</h2>
<p>To run a script, first <a href="../permissions/">make it runnable</a> using the <code>chmod</code> command shown below and then type the path and name of the file in the command line and press enter. For example, to execute a script located in the Desktop called <code>helloWord.sh</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod 775 /home/myuser/Desktop/helloWord.sh
/home/myuser//Desktop/helloWord.sh
</code></pre>
